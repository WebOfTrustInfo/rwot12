# Rebooting the Web of Trust XII: Cologne (September 18-22, 2023)

This repository contains documents related to RWOT12, the twelfth Rebooting the Web of Trust design workshop, which will be held in Cologne in Germany, from Monday, September 18th through 22, 2023.

The goal of the workshop is to generate five technical white papers and/or proposals on topics decided by the group that would have the  greatest impact on the future.

Please [sign up for our mailing list](https://www.weboftrust.info/subscribe/) to be informed as the workshop is finalized.

## Final Papers

## [*The Ecosystem Coordinatorâ€™s Role in SSI Ecosystem Management*](final-documents/ecosystem-management.pdf) [(Text)](final-documents/ecosystem-management.md)

#### by Christiane Wirrig, PhD

> The analysis builds on a draft paper from RWOT11 that developed an Enterprise SSI stakeholder map to improve our understanding of the components in an SSI ecosystem that need to be engaged to make a technical solution work commercially. It transpired that an entity called the Ecosystem Coordinator plays a fundamental part in the orchestration of an SSI ecosystem. This short RWOT12 project assesses the role of the Ecosystem Coordinator in more detail based on real-world observations. What does an Ecosystem Coordinator need to be and do to make their ecosystem work?

## Advance Readings

In advance of the design workshop, all participants are invited to contribute a one-or-two page topic paper to be shared with the other attendees on either:

   * A specific problem that they wanted to solve with a web-of-trust solution, and why current solutions (PGP or CA-based PKI) can't address the problem?
   * A specific solution related to the web-of-trust that you'd like others to use or contribute to?

Please see the [Advance Readings directory](./advance-readings/advance-reading-primer.md) for all the current papers (and how to upload yours). Advance readings from RWOT10 (cancelled due to COVID) are also included.
