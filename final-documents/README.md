# Rebooting the Web of Trust XII (Fall 2023) Final Drafts

_Final drafts are complete, polished papers that were not released as full RWOT papers because they did not meet all of the criteria for publication. Usually, this means that they were work of one person or one organization, working and being supporting within the workshop environment, but ultimately finalizing the paper on their own._

## [*The Ecosystem Coordinatorâ€™s Role in SSI Ecosystem Management*](../draft-documents/ecosystem-management.md)

It transpired that an entity called the Ecosystem Coordinator plays a fundamental part in the orchestration of an SSI ecosystem. This short RWOT12 project assesses the role of the Ecosystem Coordinator in more detail based on real-world observations. What does an Ecosystem Coordinator need to be and do to make their ecosystem work?
