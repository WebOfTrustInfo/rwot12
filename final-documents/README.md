_This is a listing for the RWOT12 papers to date. [Several more](../draft-documents/README.md) are in process._

## [*Beyond did:web*](beyond-did-web.pdf) [(Text)](beyond-did-web.md)

#### by Hans Boone, Dan Carez, Mirko Mollik, Dr. Sebastan Schmitner, Dr. Carsten Stoecker

> This paper will explore a few recent suggestions for enhancing the `did:web`
method, in particular `did:webplus` and `did:webs`. Shortcomings of `did:web` are
analyzed and a list of necessary features to overcome real problems is
assembled. We strive to avoid the problem mentioned in the [classic xkcd comic on standards](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png) and
investigate whether the did:web method can be improved without creating
yet another (few) DID methods.
## [*The Ecosystem Coordinatorâ€™s Role in SSI Ecosystem Management*](ecosystem-management.pdf) [(Text)](ecosystem-management.md)

#### by Christiane Wirrig, PhD

> The analysis builds on a draft paper from RWOT11 that developed an Enterprise SSI stakeholder map to improve our understanding of the components in an SSI ecosystem that need to be engaged to make a technical solution work commercially. It transpired that an entity called the Ecosystem Coordinator plays a fundamental part in the orchestration of an SSI ecosystem. This short RWOT12 project assesses the role of the Ecosystem Coordinator in more detail based on real-world observations. What does an Ecosystem Coordinator need to be and do to make their ecosystem work?
