# Advance Readings

In advance of the design workshop, all participants produced a
one-or-two page advance reading to be shared with the other attendees
on either:

- A specific problem that they wanted to solve with a web-of-trust solution, and why current solutions (PGP or CA-based PKI) can't address the problem?
- A specific solution related to the web-of-trust that you'd like others to use or contribute to?

If you will be attending Rebooting the Web of Trust September 2023 in Cologne, please upload your advance readings to this directory with a
pull request.

## Pull Request Submission

To add a paper, create a pull request to this repo with your
contribution (preferably as an .md file, but if you can't, as a PDF),
along with updates to the README.md in this folder. Please also
include a byline with contact information in the paper itself.

Please also enter your paper _twice_ in this README file, once in the
topical listing (adding a new category describing your topic, if
necessary) and one in the alphabetical listing. Please be sure to
include the full URL for your paper in the README, so that we can copy
it to the main page URL and have it still correctly link.

If you don't know how to submit a pull request, please instead submit an issue.

## Request RWOT12 discount code

### Privacy

[Sustainable Privacy, Authenticity, and Confidentiality](sustainableprivacy.md)
   * by Samuel M. Smith Ph.D.
   * In the SPAC whitepaper, a protocol is described using best practices with readily available cryptographic operations to provide secure privacy, authenticity, and confidentiality. The protocol provides a foundation for best practices for what we are calling sustainable privacy.

### Self-Sovereign Identity

* [Decentralized Identity and Access Control Management in Forestry 4.0](diam-forestry-4.0.md)
   * by Yongli Mou
   * Forestry 4.0, given its intrinsically decentralized and diverse framework involving multiple stakeholders and technologies, necessitates a decentralized IAM solution. This study delves into the potential application of self-sovereign identity as a viable solution to optimize access control management in Forestry 4.0 systems, thereby bolstering overall security and operational efficiency.

* [Echoes from History: Designing Self-Sovereign Identity with Care](./ssi-echoes-from-history.md)
   * by Christopher Allen
   * Self-sovereign identity represents an innovative new architecture for identity management. But, we must ensure that it avoids the pitfalls of previous identity systems. During World War II, two identity pioneers, the Dutch Jacobus L. Lentz and the French René Carmille, took different approaches toward the collection and recording of personally identifiable data. As a result, 75% of Dutch Jews fell victim to the Holocaust versus 23% of the Jews in France. Our foundational work on self-sovereign identity today could have similar repercussions down the road, so it’s imperative that we design this foundation responsibly with diligence and foresight
